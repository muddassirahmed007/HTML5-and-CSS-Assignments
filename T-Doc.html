                    <h3>ELECTRIC VEHICLE BASICS:</h3>
                        
                        

Electric vehicles (EVs) use electricity
as their primary fuel or to improve
the efficiency of conventional vehicle
designs. EVs include all-electric
vehicles, also referred to as battery
electric vehicles (BEVs), and plug-in
hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In
colloquial references, these vehicles
are called electric cars, or simply EVs,
even though some of these vehicles
still use liquid fuels in conjunction
with electricity. EVs are known for
providing instant torque and a quiet
driver experience.
Other types of electric-drive vehicles
not covered here include hybrid
electric vehicles, which are powered by
a conventional engine and an electric
motor that uses energy stored in a
battery that is charged by regenerative
braking, not by plugging in, and fuel
cell electric vehicles, which use a
propulsion system similar to electric
vehicles, where energy stored as
hydrogen is converted to electricity by
the fuel cell.
<h3>All-Electric Vehicles:</h3>
All-electric vehicles do not have
conventional engines but are driven solely
by one or more electric motors powered
by energy stored in batteries. The batteries
are charged by plugging the vehicle into an electric power source and can also be
charged through regenerative braking.
All-electric vehicles produce no tailpipe
emissions, although there are “life cycle”
emissions associated with the electricity
production.
All-electric vehicles typically have
shorter driving ranges per charge than
conventional vehicles have per tank of
gasoline. Most new BEVs are designed
to travel about 100 to 400+ miles on
a fully charged battery, depending on
the model. For context, 90% of all U.S.
household trips cover less than 100
miles.1 An all-electric vehicle’s range
varies according to driving conditions and
driving habits. Extreme temperatures tend
to reduce range because energy from the
battery powers climate control systems in
addition to powering the motor. Speeding,
aggressive driving, and heavy loads can
also reduce range.
   <h3>Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles:</h3>
 PHEVs use batteries to power an electric
motor and use another fuel, such as
gasoline, to power a conventional engine.
The batteries are typically charged by
plugging the PHEV into an electric power
source, although they can also be charged
by the conventional engine and through
regenerative braking.
PHEVs have an all-electric driving range
of about 15 to 50+ miles, depending
on the model. As long as the battery is charged, a PHEV can draw most of its
power from electricity for typical daily
driving. The engine will then kick in
when the battery is mostly depleted,
during rapid acceleration, at high
speeds, or when intensive heating or air
conditioning is required.
When running on battery power alone,
PHEVs produce no tailpipe emissions.
Even when the conventional engine is
running, PHEVs typically consume less
gasoline and produce fewer emissions
than similar conventional vehicles. 
<h3>How Much Do the
    Vehicles Cost?
    </h3>
    EVs are generally more expensive than
their conventional counterparts. However,
lower fueling and maintenance costs can
make them a competitive option. For
example, electric drivetrains are more
efficient, making BEVs (and PHEVs
operating in electric mode) more than
three times as efficient. Electricity is also
less expensive than gasoline or diesel on
an energy-equivalent basis. BEV drivers
can save as much as $14,500 in fuel costs
alone over 15 years (see table: Benefits
of Electric-Drive Vehicles).

<h3>Considering an EV -</h3>
Fleet managers should consider:
• Arranging for basic technician and
driver training
• Conducting site planning for charging
units, including setbacks, electrical
service locations, potential service
upgrade needs, and future upgrades
• Determining when and how the
vehicles will charge (including working
with utilities to understand time-of-use and demand charges), as well as
managed charging
• Exploring private or utility incentives
for equipment installation or power use
• Evaluating equipment vendors and
considering needs/options such as
smart charging, cloud communications,
vendor payment, and equipment ownership and maintenance
• Timing the purchase and installation
of charging units with the delivery
of vehicles (this can be especially
slow/complicated for municipal
organizations).
For medium- and heavy-duty vehicles,
there are additional considerations:
• Examining auxiliary loads (e.g.,
heating/cooling, lights, power take-off/
hydraulics use), and optional auxiliary
power units or heating, ventilating, and
air-conditioning (HVAC) units powered
by diesel or another fuel
• Determining the impacts of increased
electricity consumption, especially
when several vehicles need to be
charged simultaneously at high
charging rates
• Understanding original equipment
manufacturer vehicle maintenance and
support if issues arise.
